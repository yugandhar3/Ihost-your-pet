                                The iHostYourPet Service consists of
                                a desktop Web application, mobile applications, and other related tools,
                                support and services that pet owners (<b>“Pet Owners”</b>)  can use to find, communicate with and interact with each other. As of incorporation of these terms, iHostYourPet is in BETA, trial mode, and the services provided are still in the transitory phase. As part of this phase, we provide a limited set of service focused on facilitating only contact between Pet Owners.

                            </p>

                                <u>2.2 iHostYourPet does not provide Pet Care Services</u><br /><br />
                                iHostYourPet is a neutral venue for Pet Owners. iHostYourPet is not a Service Provider for pets. We make no representations or warranties about the quality of boarding, pet sitting, dog walking, house sitting, or other services provided by hosting Pet Owners (<b>“Pet Care Services”</b>), or about your interactions and dealings with users. Pet Owners listed on iHostYourPet are not under the direction or control of iHostYourPet, and they determine in their own discretion how to provide Pet Care Services. Though we may provide general guidance on our Site to Pet Owners about safety and about  pet care and to Pet Owners about selecting and engaging Service Providers, iHostYourPet does not employ, recommend or endorse Pet Owners, and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we will not be responsible or liable for the performance or conduct of Pet Owners, whether online or offline. We currently DO NOT conduct a review of Pet Owners’ profiles and we DO NOT currently facilitate Background Checks or Identification Verifications on Pet Owners. You should exercise caution and use your independent judgment before engaging a Pet Owner, providing Pet Care Services, or otherwise interacting with users via the iHostYourPet Service. Pet Owners are solely responsible for making decisions that are in the best interests of themselves and their pets. For example, each user of the iHostYourPet Service is responsible for keeping current his or her own pet’s vaccinations, and we will have no liability for anyone’s failure to vaccinate his or her pet.

You acknowledge and agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by the applicable law, YOUR USE AND/OR PROVISION OF PET CARE SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE RISK. (Any financial obligations iHostYourPet may have to its users in connection with user conduct are limited to the reimbursement obligations set forth in the iHostYourPet Guarantee.)</b>

                                The iHostYourPet Service may be used to find and offer Pet Care Services, but all transactions conducted via the iHostYourPet Service are between all the member Pet Owners. There are no financial transactions in regards to Pet Services provided by Pet Owners via the iHostYourPet Service. The Pet Owners earn credits from iHostYourPet (1 point for every day they host another Pet Owner’s pet), and spend credits(1 point for every day)  every time they have their pet hosted by another Pet Owner. No financial transaction takes place between the Pet Owners for any service related to iHostYourPet Service. You agree that iHostYourPet has no liability for damages associated with Pet Care Services (which may include bodily injury to, or death of, a pet) or resulting from any other transactions between users of the iHostYourPet Service.

                                <u>2.5 Bookings</u><br /><br />
                                Pet Owners transact with each other on the iHostYourPet Service when they both agree to a “booking” that specifies the time period, cancellation policy, and other terms for provision of Pet Care Services via the booking mechanism provided on the iHostYourPet Service (a “Booking”). A Booking may be initiated by a Pet Owner by selecting the type(s) of Pet Care Services to be provided and then following the prompts that appear on-screen. As a Pet Owner you initiate a Booking, you agree for a deduction of credits equivalent to the number of days your pet is being hosted, and transfer of those credits/points to the hosting member when your booking is confirmed. If you don’t have enough points/credits in your account, your points/credits will go negative, which means you need to host some pets before making another booking after this booking event. As the Pet Owner hosting the pet, your account will be credited the number of days you are hosting the pet, once the booking is confirmed. All requests are subject to acceptance by the receiving party. The receiving party is not obligated to accept your (or any) request and may, at their discretion, decline for any reason. You acknowledge that, once you complete a Booking, you agree to honor the terms of that Booking, as acknowledged in the Booking confirmation.

                                <u>2.6 Pet Owners are Solely Responsible for Evaluating Service Providers</u><br /><br />
                                Pet Owners are solely responsible for evaluating the suitability of Service Providers for the services they offer to provide. iHostYourPet does not currently perform any type of screening of members and does not warrant accuracy of any information provided by the Pet Owners to iHostYourPet as part of their registration.

                                <u>2.7 Abandoned Pets, Re-homing</u><br /><br />
                                iHostYourPet currently does not take any responsibility for pets when the Pet Owners fail to  retrieve their pet after the service period identified in a Booking has ended. It will be upto the Pet Owner who is hosting the pet to take the appropriate actions to deal with the abandoned pets.
                            </p>

                                <u>2.8 Emergencies</u><br /><br />
                                We recommend that Pet Owners give their Service Providers contact information where they can be reached in the event medical care for a pet becomes necessary. Service Providers agree to immediately contact Pet Owners in the event such care becomes necessary or, if the Pet Owner is not available, use their discretion on the actions to be taken. If you are a Pet Owner whose pet is being hosted, you hereby authorize your Service Provider to obtain and authorize the provision of veterinary care for your pet if you cannot be reached to authorize care yourself in an emergency situation. In such a case, you also authorize your pet’s veterinarian(s) to release your pet’s veterinary records to the host. If your Service Provider reaches you with a request to authorize medical care for your pet and you refuse, you release the Service Provider and iHostYourPet for any injury, damage or liability arising from failure to seek such care. Pet Owners are responsible for the costs of any such medical treatment for pets.
                            </p>
